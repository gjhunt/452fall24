## Website

Information for the course can be found on blackboard or on [github](https://gjhunt.github.io/452fall24)

## Lectures

Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays. I will post a .pdf of the lectures from each class. Attendance is not required. 

## Text

The suggested text is [Statistical Inference (2nd) by George Casella and Roger L. Berger](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/8131503941/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1RQSOYI6ICIYD&keywords=Statistical+Inference+by+Casella%2C+George%2C+Berger&qid=1643138086&s=books&sprefix=statistical+inference+by+casella%2C+george%2C+berger%2Cstripbooks%2C47&sr=1-4)
  
The text is not required but highly recommended. 

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person in my office Jones 125 at the times posted above. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email.

## Weekly Quiz Problems (QPs)

Most weeks I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following week either Tues or Thurs at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 20% of your final grade. The lowest two QP grades will be dropped. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers. 

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 a zero will be entered for the grade. By droppping the lowest two grades, missing one or two won't hurt your grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP. 

## Suggested Problems (SPs)

Additionally I will post a selection of suggested problems along with solutions (on blackboard). You are highly encouraged to do these problems as just doing just the one quiz problem will not be enough to prepare you for the midterm and final. I will also post suggested reading along with the suggested problems. 

## Midterms

There will be two in-persons midterms during normal lecture times. They will be at the dates in the table above (in class). The midterms will account for 25% of the grade each. 

## Final

The final exam will be as scheduled by the registrar (see above). The exam will be comprehensive.

### Mental and Physical Well Being

William & Mary recognizes that students have many different responsibilities and can face challenges that make learning difficult.  There are many resources available at W&M to help students. Asking for help is a sign of courage and strength.  Please reach out to me if you or someone you know are facing problems inside or outside the classroom, and I will do my best to guide you to appropriate resources on campus.   Those resources include: 

- For psychological/emotional stress, there is the W&M Counseling Center (757-221-362), 240 Gooch Dr. 2nd floor, [(https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/counselingcenter/)](https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/counselingcenter/). Services are free and confidential.

the heart of the university, and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor
